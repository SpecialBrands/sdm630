# SDM680 Whitelabel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SpecialBrands/sdm680.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SpecialBrands/sdm680) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/SpecialBrands/sdm680?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/SpecialBrands/sdm680)

There are a number of white labelled SDM680, for example the Smart Processing SMARTRAIL X835 or the Eastron SDM680. This library enumerates the items that can be queried from these devices.

**NOTE**: The values that these devices produce are [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-points.

# Testing

This code has been manually tested with these devices, however they are not tested with these devices in the Continuous Integration.
